# Anything

[https://tryanything.xyz](https://tryanything.xyz/)

We want to make it simpler to use and hack AI into your life in business.

Langchain, BabyAGI, LLamaIndex etc all require you to jacl with code all the time and don't have any system for repeating tasks, simple things like crons, queues, or databases to store *normal* data.

Anything is built with the core principles of LLM chaining frameworks with a twist.

Low Code. Local First. Simple AF. Hackable.

Taking inspiration from Open Source SOP ( Standard Operating Procedure ) WYSIWYG Doucmenting Systems like BPMN ( Business Process Modeling Notaion ) mixed with the fundamentals of distributed architecture ( serverless, processing queues ) were building the NextJS of "Blue Collar AI" or AI systems meant to do reptitive tasks that we can free humanity from.
