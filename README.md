# Architecture

## Core Goals
- An open automation tool that allows for maximum creativity and extensibility without sacrificing __understandability__. 
- An architecture that lends itself towards the __incremental adoption of new AI__ no matter which "shape" it takes
- An architecture that is focused on skating towards the puck of __self authoring__ by storing state, logs, events etc in human centric, sovereign mediums easily understood and created by low cost local LLM's. 

##### Application state is __Simple and Understandable__
- State of flows is just a __file__ that can be kept in __version control__
- State is __File First__ which means it can be edited from an IDE or the Application with equal support.
- Triggers, Actions, and Flows are portable and fully encapsulated.
- File and Folder names are __Human Centric__ following similar design patters as NextJS routing.

##### Application does not require docker
- Makes it easy to adopt like normal apps
- Makes it so it can run all day even on low powered devices

#### Event Processing focuses on simple vs fast. Buts its still fast. 
- Events are stored in an event queue based on SQLite
- Starting and stopping at any point is easy.
- Past state is all visible making it easy to debug failure

##### Extensibility without sacrificing understandability
- Each Action is defined by an Extension.
- Think of Extensions the same as in VSCode but they process events.
- You only download the extensions you need protecting the project from "package bloat"
- You can author your own extensions or grab them from the community
- Extensions are written in Rust so you can also write them in other interpretted languages like Python or Typescript

##### Extension Interface
- defines an "execution" function to process events
- defines a "validation" function for validating user configuration dynamically. This also helps LLM's write config with high certainty from the feedback
- defines an "action" the node a user see's, the SVG, the name, default arguments, etc
- has access to event system and full flow definition it exists inside of to allow for arbitrary complexity of loop and decision nodes that are a common problem point in automation tools. 

#### User Interface
- Designed to be __self describing__ so at first glance flows describe what they do more than "how" they do it.
- Configuring is done through {{templating}} arguments with access to previous results, .env, system constants etc.

#### Logs
- Everything logged into Open Telemetry
- Makes even application bugs accessible as a single layer to future self authoring AI so it can tell if a problem is form the software or the user
- Makes easy to adopt into different clouds and organizations
