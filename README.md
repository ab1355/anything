# Anything

## A simple tool for using AI in your life.

[https://tryanything.xyz](https://tryanything.xyz/)

Langchain, BabyAGI, LLamaIndex etc all require you to build with code all the time and don't have any system for simple things like repeating tasks, crons, queues, or databases to store *normal* data.

Anything is built with the core principles of LLM chaining frameworks with a twist.

### Low Code.
### Local First.
### Extendable. 

The flows built in the wysiwyg designer are just TOML files. 
The nodes/tools/actions are built in the same way. 

### Design the automations you love locally. 
### Deploy your automations wherevery you host usually. 

The projects goal is to create massive upside through making it easy and enjoyable for individuals to share their AI automtations so that others can use them for free or for hire.
