# Architecture Goals

- An open automation tool that allows for maximum creativity and extensibility without sacrificing <ins>understandability</ins>.
- An architecture that lends itself towards the <ins>incremental adoption of new AI</ins> no matter which "shape" it takes
- An architecture that is focused on skating towards the puck of <ins>self authoring</ins> by storing state, logs, events etc in human centric, sovereign mediums easily understood and created by low cost LLM's.

##### Extensibility without sacrificing understandability

- Each Action Type is defined by a Plugin.
- Think of Plugins the same as in VSCode but they execute tasks.
- You can <ins>author your own plugins</ins> or grab them from the community.
- Plugins are WASM and can be written in any language that can compile to it.

#### User Interface Opinions

- Designed to be <ins>self describing</ins> so at first glance flows describe what they do more than "how" they do it
- Configuring is done through {{templating}} arguments with access to previous results, .env, system constants etc
