### üîß Setting Up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tryanything-ai/anything.git
pnpm quick
```

### üíª Developing
```bash
pnpm dev
```
-> runs all shared packages in watch mode. 
-> runs tauri && website && docs (soon)

For a lighter weight experience just run dev on the app you are working on in /apps and remember to build or dev the packages it consumes if your working on them

Repo structure based on turborepo tailwind template

### Flows are defined as TOML Files

- All flows are just files that can live in Version Control
- Inspired by NextJS routing a flow just lives at ~/Documents/Flows/{Flow Name} in your computer
