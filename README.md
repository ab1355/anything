Langchain, BabyAGI, LLamaIndex etc all require you to jacl with code all the time and don't have any system for repeating tasks, simple things like crons, queues, or databases to store *normal* data.

Anything is built with the core principles of LLM chaining frameworks with a twist.

Low Code.
Local First.
Simple AF.
Hackable.

Taking inspiration from Open Source SOP ( Standard Operating Procedure ) WYSIWYG Doucmenting Systems like BPMN ( Business Process Modeling Notaion ) mixed with the fundamentals of distributed architecture ( serverless, processing queues ) were building the NextJS of "Blue Collar AI" or AI systems meant to do reptitive tasks that we can free humanity from.
