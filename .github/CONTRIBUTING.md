# Contributing to Anything

Hi there! Thank you for even being interested in contributing to Anything.
As an open source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open
to contributions, whether they be in the form of new features, better documentation, or bug fixes.

## 🗺️ Guidelines

### 👩‍💻 Contributing Code

To contribute to this project, please follow a ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow.
Please do not try to push directly to this repo unless you are maintainer.

Your pull request should never target main. 
You should target dev or a related working branch related to your pull request if it exists.

Note related issues and tag relevant maintainers.

We're a small, building-oriented team. If there's something you'd like to add or change, opening a pull request is the
best way to get our attention.

### 🚩GitHub Issues

Our [issues](https://github.com/tryanything-ai/anything/issues) page is kept up to date
with bugs, improvements, and feature requests. 

If you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself.

If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single, modular bug/improvement/feature.

If two issues are related, or blocking, please link them rather than combining them.

We will try to keep these issues as up to date as possible, though
with the rapid rate of develop in this field some may get out of date.
If you notice this happening, please let us know.

### 🙋Getting Help

Our goal is to have the simplest developer setup possible. Should you experience any difficulty getting setup, please
contact a maintainer! Not only do we want to help get you unblocked, but we also want to make sure that the process is
smooth for future contributors.

## 🏭 Release Process

Anything follows the [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning standard. However, as pre-1.0 software,
even patch releases may contain [non-backwards-compatible changes](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

### 🌟 Recognition

If your contribution has made its way into a release, we will want to give you credit on Twitter (only if you want though)!
If you have a Twitter account you would like us to mention, please let us know in the PR or in another manner.
